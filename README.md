# mel (Matter-Eater Lad)
Mel is a small Rust binary that carries a payload of tools... beyond that not sure what I want it to do yet or if I'll throw it into the campfire when I'm done.

The reason for this little tool is first so I can learn some Rust. The secondary problem I'm solving is in the infrastructure automation space there's a medium-sized toolbox worth of tools needed to stand up infrastructure and test it.  And if the tools are not the correct version that just makes things break or act in odd ways. Mel will embed with all the needed tools inside of it using https://github.com/pyros2097/rust-embed.  This approach also protects against a file artifact system from being down. This last one I'm kinda stretching things as I'm not sure that is a full reason for doing this. I mean this isn't running in an air-gapped context where the network shouldn't be available.  But I like the idea and I want to use some Rust for a project that could be useful.
